Loops in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
They allow you to run code based on a condition and continue running it until that condition is no longer true. 
This helps reduce redundancy, improves code efficiency, and makes tasks like iterating through arrays or performing repeated calculations much easier.
