Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript:
The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to store data that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program. 
Variables act as placeholders for values such as numbers, strings, and objects, and allow the program to work dynamically by using and changing that data over time.

Declaring variables is essential for:

1.Storing data: Values like numbers, strings, or objects are assigned to variables.
2.Reusing values: Once declared, the variable can be used throughout your code.
3.Organizing your code: Variables help keep your code structured and readable.
