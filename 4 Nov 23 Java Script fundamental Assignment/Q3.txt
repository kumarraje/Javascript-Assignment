In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on the number of operands they work with. 
The two primary types are unary and binary operators.

Unary Operators
Definition: Operate on a single operand.
Purpose: Often used for operations like incrementing, negating a value, or checking the type.

Binary Operators
Definition: Operate on two operands.
Purpose: Used for arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operations.
