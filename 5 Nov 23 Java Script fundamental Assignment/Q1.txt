JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

Role of JavaScript in Web Development:

Client-Side Interactivity:
JavaScript allows developers to build interactive features like sliders, forms, drop-down menus, pop-ups, and more, directly in the browser without requiring a page reload.

DOM Manipulation:
JavaScript can access and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing dynamic updates to the structure, style, and content of web pages.

Form Validation:
JavaScript is commonly used for validating user input in forms before sending data to a server, enhancing user experience and reducing server load.

Asynchronous Communication (AJAX):
JavaScript enables web pages to request data from servers in the background, allowing updates without refreshing the entire page (e.g., loading new content in social media feeds).

Event Handling:
JavaScript responds to user actions like clicks, key presses, and mouse movements, making web applications more interactive.

Building Web Applications:
With frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, JavaScript is used to build full-scale single-page applications (SPAs) and complex user interfaces.

Server-Side Development:
Through environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server to handle backend logic, databases, and APIs.
